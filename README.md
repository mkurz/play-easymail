# [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joscha/play-easymail.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joscha/play-easymail) play-easymail - an extension to the Typesafe mailer plugin for Play! Framework 2.x (Java)

This plugin uses concepts from [Play20StartApp][] to make sending emails (text, html, mixed) easier. A sample is included.

#### Version information
**play-easymail currently needs Play! Framework 2.x**

play-easymail is cross-tested with Java 1.6, Java 1.7 and Java 1.8

* The `master` branch contains the code for Play! Framework 2.4.x (play-easymail version `0.7.0` and up).
* The `2.3.x` branch contains the code for 2.3.x (play-easymail version `0.6 - 0.6.x`).
* The `2.2.x` branch contains the code for 2.2.x (play-easymail version `0.5 - 0.5.x`).
* The `2.1.x` branch contains the code for 2.1.x (play-easymail version `0.2 - 0.3.x`).
* The `2.0.x` is a maintenance branch for the 2.0.x series of Play! Framework (play-easymail version `0.1`).

## Features
Sending email through an easy-to-use API and allowing for text-only, html-only and mixed emails. Preferably based on Play! templates (see sample).

## Code sample
```java
Mailer.getDefaultMailer().sendMail(
    "Your subject",
    "Your text body",
    "recipient@email.com"
);
```
You can also have a look at the [sample](samples/play-easymail-usage/app/controllers/Application.java) for a more advanced use-case (content from templates and setting custom headers).
